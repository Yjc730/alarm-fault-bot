Note that if the network synchronization malfunction lasts for a long time, the alarm is canceled when the BTS frequency reaches the faulty reference synchronization. The alarm can also be activated if the faulty reference synchronization is corrected and there is, again, a difference of 0.2 ppm or more. The alarm is canceled whenever the difference becomes less than 0.2 ppm. 2. The reference frequency fluctuates continuously because of a significant amount of jitter or wander in the transmission network. The alarm is continuously activated or canceled. However, the alarming state might predominate. There is always some jitter or wander in the transmission network; the limits are defined in ITU-T G.823\/824\/825. 3. If the BTS-integrated transport part receives the synchronization information through the 2.048 MHz synchronization input (external clock source), the alarm situation might be caused by a fault of that signal. In that case, the alarm behavior notifications listed with the Iub signal (see the above) are also valid. 4. There is an equipment fault in the BTS.

    "meaning":"Due to a failure, the BTSOAM has detected during BTS startup, BTS recommissioning, or BTS resource reassignment that at least one of the following items is missing: - Radio resources - Flexi signal processing (FSP) resource - Cables between the system module and the radio unit (RU), cables between the extension baseband module (FBBx or ABIx) and the RU, or inter-ABIO-Loki in-phase and quadrature (IQ) links to set up the cell according to the configuration requested in the site configuration file (SCF) - Physical random access channel (PRACH) resources - Layer 3 pool resources. This fault is detected when a unit that supports a cell is replaced by another unit whose hardware differs from the hardware of the previous unit (different capacity, type of ports, and so on). A BTS reset might be required. The fault is detected for cells with sufficient digital signal processing resources that are configured in the same carrier aggregation pool as the cell with missing DSP resources. The fault can be detected for cells planned to be allocated to an ABIO, ABIN, or ABIQ capacity plug-in unit when BBMOD.bbmodBoardConfigType of that unit is set to \"auto\", and the correct board configuration can't be deduced from the SCF. The fault can also be detected for an AirScale BTS due to an incorrect baseband pool configuration when the baseband pooling feature is activated (actBbpooling set to \"true\"). This fault is detected when the RP3-01 links are lost between one of the following pairs: - System modules (in the case of Flexi Multiradio 10 System Module (FSMF) + FSMF) - System module and its connected RU - Capacity plug-in unit (ABIA) and a system module (in the case of AirScale BTS + FSMF) - Capacity plug-in unit (ABIA) and a capacity extension sub-module (FBBx) (in the case of AirScale BTS + FSMF) This fault is detected when the beam ID range isn't broad enough to allocate the TDD Massive MIMO (mMIMO) cell to the Enhanced Common Public Radio Interface (eCPRI) TDD Massive MIMO Adaptive Antenna (MAA) or RU. The fault is detected when there aren't enough carrier component resources for the TDD mMIMO cell allocated on the eCPRI TDD MAA or RU product code. It's detected when there aren't enough extended antenna carrier (eAxC) addresses for the TDD mMIMO cell located on the eCPRI TDD MAA or RU product code. It's also detected when BBMOD.prioritizedRAT mismatches the actual site configuration on ABIN. The fault can also be detected for a 5G cell due to: - an improper 5G beamforming RU type. - not supporting external antenna beamforming. - not supporting external antenna with subsectorization. - not supporting antenna panel split mode. - configuring a beamforming cell for a non-beamforming RU. - using an AHQK RU for external antenna beamforming. - an insufficient RU memory cache for the requested PIDs. - the total number of PIDs with type RealTimeSRSDL allocated per radio exceeds rtPidCapacity. — It isn't applicable to standalone FSMF\/FSIH and FSMF+FSMF configurations. The fault is detected for a 5G beamforming cell if the detected radio isn't a 5G O-RAN radio or doesn't support beamforming. The fault can also be detected for a 5G cell when cell allocation is impossible due to commissioned cells on CPRI-A RUs or due to a Nokia Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI-N) RU being cabled in the same ABIL board. This fault can be detected for a 5G cell that is on a capacity plug-in unit supporting physical resource block (PRB) pooling (ABIO, ABIN, ABIP, ABIQ), or on an ASOE or ASOF core unit when the PRB pooling is enabled on the gNB without free baseband pool capability for the current dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) RM of the PRACH index pair {12,13,40} or {14,15,41,42,43}. This fault can be detected for a 5G cell when a capacity plug-in unit or core module port associated with one or more LOGLINKs has exceeded its defined port capacity. This fault can also be detected for a 5G cell due to a degraded cell setup during 5G Cell Lock or Delta Recommissioning if the 5G cell is enabled, degraded, or online. This fault can be detected for an unsupported broken-cell type combination. This fault can be detected due to a wrong configuration of parameters for ABIO\/ASOE. This fault can be detected for NR FDD cells with a bandwidth larger than 20 MHz to be placed on the baseband card or cells exceeding baseband resources when BBMOD.prioritizedRAT is set to \"LTE\" or \"NR\". The fault can be detected when ABIQ is in concurrent mode or concurrent tri-mode and a cell with NRCELL.numberOfRxBeamforming set to 8Rx is being assigned to this board.",

    "fault_name":"BTS reset required",
    "meaning":"This fault notifies the operator that the BTS needs a reset to solve a problem discovered by the BTS O&M system. 1. The BTS has detected a commissioned (configured in SCF) extension baseband module (FBBC, ABIA, or ABIC) that wasn't detected during the BTS startup. Thus, the BTS needs to be reset to use the module. 6. The BTS O&M system has detected (in runtime) radio unit (RU) resources necessary for the cell setup, which weren't detected during the BTS startup, for example, a commissioned RU (configured in an SCF) or an optical cable. The BTS needs to be reset to set up the cell with the use of the detected RU or cable. In this case, LCR is the source of the fault. This is valid for all RATs except for 4G and 5G cells. If actCellAutoRecalculation is set, the 4G or 5G cell can be configured on any BBMOD (excluding FSMr3, ABIA, and ABIC) and mapped to an OBSAI, CPRI, or eCPRI radio. It's not applicable to FSMF\/FSIH and FSMF+FSMF configurations. 7. The BTS O&M has detected an extension baseband module (for example, FBBC) on the same QSFP port, which is different than the previously removed baseband card, such as FBBA. The BTS needs to be reset to use the module. 8. An FSP unit wasn't ready during the BTS startup, for example, because of a unit boot software update. The BTS needs to be reset to put the module into use. 9. The BTS clears the alarm and triggers an autonomous BTS reset to enable normal BTS operability, but the BTS reset counter has been exceeded. The operator needs to perform a BTS reset to enable operation in the BTS. 10. There is an internal problem resulting in a failure of activation or deactivation of a snapshot collection, triggered by the syslog substring. A BTS reset performed by the operator might solve this issue. 11. The phase synchronization source wasn't available in the BTS startup, and an alarm with fault 4153 was raised. The phase synchronization source is available. A BTS reset is needed to activate features requiring network-level synchronization (OTDOA, eICIC, MBMS, and Inter-BTS carrier aggregation). 12. The BTS can't execute an FSP or BTS autonomous recovery reset due to one of the following reasons: - It will turn off all working cells. - There is an internal BTS limitation. Note: This case is available only on the BTS. 13. The FSP card is plugged but not detected. A BTS reset is needed to recover the FSP. 14. The FSP autonomous recovery reset has failed. A BTS reset is necessary to try to recover the FSP. Note: This case is available only on the Flexi SBTS. 17. The FSP power fails after clearing fault 4077 (the FSP is overheated). A BTS reset is needed to try to put the FSP into use. 18. The module plug-in software is downloaded to the BTS for O-RAN radio units that were operational before. A BTS reset is needed for the software to take effect. 19.1. The FSP is lost due to fault 10 (no connection to a unit). If the affected FSP supports the WCDMA cells, then a site reset is needed to recover the WCDMA cells. 19.2. The FSP is detected after clearing fault 4077 (FSP overheated) or fault 10 (no connection to a unit). If the affected FSP supports the WCDMA cells and all FSPs supporting WCDMA are enabled, then a RAT reset is needed to recover the WCDMA cells. If the affected FSP supports the WCDMA cells and no FSP supporting WCDMA is enabled, then a site reset is needed to recover the WCDMA cells. If the affected FSP supports the GSM cells, then a RAT reset is needed to recover the GSM cells. 20. The loose phase time synchronization source wasn't available in the BTS startup, and an alarm with fault 4404 (timing accuracy not guaranteed to be within configured LTE limits for loose HSFN) or 2417 (timing accuracy not guaranteed to be within configured GSM limits for loose HSFN) was raised. The loose phase time synchronization source is available. A BTS reset is needed to activate features requiring loose phase-level synchronization (for example, eDRX). 21.1. During the BTS runtime, the BTS O&M system has (re)detected resources necessary for the cell setup, for example, a commissioned secondary core. a) FSMF + FSMF: To use the resources, in the case of GSM and WCDMA, a site reset is necessary. The GSM RAT or WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. b) AirScale + FSMF: The baseband topology calculation isn't possible for a BTS hardware configuration that includes the split radio module(s) connected to both BTS cores (requires inter-core RP3 timing alignment, which temporarily deactivates the LTE cells). To use the resources, in the case of GSM and WCDMA, a site reset is necessary. The GSM RAT or WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. c) AirScale + FSMF: The baseband resources are reallocated due to a short SRIO link break. To use the resources, in the case of GSM, a RAT reset is necessary. The GSM RAT is the source of fault in this case. d) AirScale + AirScale (WCDMA is commissioned on both BTS primary and secondary cores): To use the resources, in the case of WCDMA, a RAT reset is necessary. The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. e) AirScale + AirScale (WCDMA is commissioned on both BTS primary and secondary cores, or WCDMA is commissioned only on a BTS secondary core): The BTS secondary core (that was detected during the BTS startup) is reset (hot remove & hot insert) in runtime. In the case of WCDMA, to use the resources, a RAT reset is necessary. The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. 21.2 During the BTS runtime, the BTS O&M system has (re)detected resources necessary for the cell setup, for example, a commissioned BBMOD. a) AirScale + AirScale or AirScale (Single Core) or AirScale + FSMF: A BBMOD (that was detected but uncommissioned during the BTS startup) is commissioned after startup, and WCDMA BB resources are recalculated and allocated to bring full WCDMA operability. In the case of WCDMA, to use the resources, a RAT reset is necessary. The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. b) AirScale + AirScale or AirScale (Single Core) or AirScale + FSMF: A BBMOD (that is running Distributed WCDMA RAT SW) is reset in runtime. In the case of WCDMA, to use the resources, a RAT reset is necessary. The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. 22.1. The BTS O&M has a late detection of the RP3-01 link, which wasn't available during the BTS startup and before the deployment calculation, while the source of synchronization between cores is provided by the SyncOut\/SyncIn link. A BTS reset is needed to cover the affected cells. 22.2. The BTS O&M has a late detection of the RP3-01 link, which wasn't available during the BTS startup and before the deployment calculation when the RP3-01 link is used for the GSM and WCDMA IQ data routing between ABIA and FSMF\/FBBx (in AirScale + FSMF dual-core configuration). A BTS reset is needed to cover the affected cells. 24. SYNC.phaseErrorRecoveryThreshold is exceeded. A BTS reset is needed to clear the synchronization phase error. 25. The BTS can't synchronize with the RRH in the CPRI-K RF sharing because of clock crossing buffer underflow or overflow in the RX block. A BTS reset is needed to synchronize with RRH (radio). 26. Plan activation is stuck due to an unknown reason. A BTS reset is needed to recover. 30. The $FeatureName feature triggers a recovery reset due to the time to recover below its allowed time error, which is above the limit, as configured in $syncTemplateDn. Where: - $FeatureName is the name of the feature (for example, 'OTDOA'). - $syncTemplateDn is the distinguished name of the SYNCTEMPLATE instance linked to the feature, for example, 'MRBTS-1\/MNL-1\/MNLENT-1\/SYNC-1\/SYNCTEMPLATE-1'. An example of an alarm text: 'The feature OTDOA triggers a recovery reset due to the time to recover below its allowed time error is above the limit as configured in MRBTS-1\/MNL-1\/MNLENT-1\/SYNC-1\/SYNCTEMPLATE-1.' It's not applicable to FSMF\/FSIH and FSMF+FSMF configurations.",

The operator needs to perform a BTS reset to enable operation in the BTS. 10. There is an internal problem resulting in a failure of activation or deactivation of a snapshot collection, triggered by the syslog substring. A BTS reset performed by the operator might solve this issue. 11. The phase synchronization source wasn't available in the BTS startup, and an alarm with fault 4153 was raised. The phase synchronization source is available. A BTS reset is needed to activate features requiring network-level synchronization (OTDOA, eICIC, MBMS, and Inter-BTS carrier aggregation). 12. The BTS can't execute an FSP or BTS autonomous recovery reset due to one of the following reasons: - It will turn off all working cells. - There is an internal BTS limitation. Note: This case is available only on the BTS. 13. The FSP card is plugged but not detected. A BTS reset is needed to recover the FSP. 14. The FSP autonomous recovery reset has failed. A BTS reset is necessary to try to recover the FSP. Note: This case is available only on the Flexi SBTS. 17. The FSP power fails after clearing fault 4077 (the FSP is overheated). A BTS reset is needed to try to put the FSP into use. 18. The module plug-in software is downloaded to the BTS for O-RAN radio units that were operational before. A BTS reset is needed for the software to take effect. 19.1. The FSP is lost due to fault 10 (no connection to a unit). If the affected FSP supports the WCDMA cells, then a site reset is needed to recover the WCDMA cells. 19.2. The FSP is detected after clearing fault 4077 (FSP overheated) or fault 10 (no connection to a unit). If the affected FSP supports the WCDMA cells and all FSPs supporting WCDMA are enabled, then a RAT reset is needed to recover the WCDMA cells. If the affected FSP supports the WCDMA cells and no FSP supporting WCDMA is enabled, then a site reset is needed to recover the WCDMA cells. If the affected FSP supports the GSM cells, then a RAT reset is needed to recover the GSM cells. 20. The loose phase time synchronization source wasn't available in the BTS startup, and an alarm with fault 4404 (timing accuracy not guaranteed to be within configured LTE limits for loose HSFN) or 2417 (timing accuracy not guaranteed to be within configured GSM limits for loose HSFN) was raised. The loose phase time synchronization source is available. A BTS reset is needed to activate features requiring loose phase-level synchronization (for example, eDRX). 21.1. During the BTS runtime, the BTS O&M system has (re)detected resources necessary for the cell setup, for example, a commissioned secondary core. a) FSMF + FSMF: To use the resources, in the case of GSM and WCDMA, a site reset is necessary. The GSM RAT or WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. b) AirScale + FSMF: The baseband topology calculation isn't possible for a BTS hardware configuration that includes the split radio module(s) connected to both BTS cores (requires inter-core RP3 timing alignment, which temporarily deactivates the LTE cells). To use the resources, in the case of GSM and WCDMA, a site reset is necessary. The GSM RAT or WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. c) AirScale + FSMF: The baseband resources are reallocated due to a short SRIO link break. To use the resources, in the case of GSM, a RAT reset is necessary. The GSM RAT is the source of fault in this case. d) AirScale + AirScale (WCDMA is commissioned on both BTS primary and secondary cores): To use the resources, in the case of WCDMA, a RAT reset is necessary. The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. e) AirScale + AirScale (WCDMA is commissioned on both BTS primary and secondary cores, or WCDMA is commissioned only on a BTS secondary core): The BTS secondary core (that was detected during the BTS startup) is reset (hot remove & hot insert) in runtime. In the case of WCDMA, to use the resources, a RAT reset is necessary. The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. 21.2 During the BTS runtime, the BTS O&M system has (re)detected resources necessary for the cell setup, for example, a commissioned BBMOD. a) AirScale + AirScale or AirScale (Single Core) or AirScale + FSMF: A BBMOD (that was detected but uncommissioned during the BTS startup) is commissioned after startup, and WCDMA BB resources are recalculated and allocated to bring full WCDMA operability. In the case of WCDMA, to use the resources, a RAT reset is necessary. The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. b) AirScale + AirScale or AirScale (Single Core) or AirScale + FSMF: A BBMOD (that is running Distributed WCDMA RAT SW) is reset in runtime. In the case of WCDMA, to use the resources, a RAT reset is necessary. The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. 22.1. The BTS O&M has a late detection of the RP3-01 link, which wasn't available during the BTS startup and before the deployment calculation, while the source of synchronization between cores is provided by the SyncOut\/SyncIn link. A BTS reset is needed to cover the affected cells. 22.2. The BTS O&M has a late detection of the RP3-01 link, which wasn't available during the BTS startup and before the deployment calculation when the RP3-01 link is used for the GSM and WCDMA IQ data routing between ABIA and FSMF\/FBBx (in AirScale + FSMF dual-core configuration). A BTS reset is needed to cover the affected cells. 24. SYNC.phaseErrorRecoveryThreshold is exceeded. A BTS reset is needed to clear the synchronization phase error. 25. The BTS can't synchronize with the RRH in the CPRI-K RF sharing because of clock crossing buffer underflow or overflow in the RX block. A BTS reset is needed to synchronize with RRH (radio). 26. Plan activation is stuck due to an unknown reason. A BTS reset is needed to recover. 30. The $FeatureName feature triggers a recovery reset due to the time to recover below its allowed time error, which is above the limit, as configured in $syncTemplateDn. Where: - $FeatureName is the name of the feature (for example, 'OTDOA'). - $syncTemplateDn is the distinguished name of the SYNCTEMPLATE instance linked to the feature, for example, 'MRBTS-1\/MNL-1\/MNLENT-1\/SYNC-1\/SYNCTEMPLATE-1'.

    "meaning":"This fault notifies the operator that the BTS needs a reset to solve a problem discovered by the BTS O&M system. 1. The BTS has detected a commissioned (configured in SCF) extension baseband module (FBBC, ABIA, or ABIC) that wasn't detected during the BTS startup. Thus, the BTS needs to be reset to use the module. 6. The BTS O&M system has detected (in runtime) radio unit (RU) resources necessary for the cell setup, which weren't detected during the BTS startup, for example, a commissioned RU (configured in an SCF) or an optical cable. The BTS needs to be reset to set up the cell with the use of the detected RU or cable. In this case, LCR is the source of the fault. This is valid for all RATs except for 4G and 5G cells. If actCellAutoRecalculation is set, the 4G or 5G cell can be configured on any BBMOD (excluding FSMr3, ABIA, and ABIC) and mapped to an OBSAI, CPRI, or eCPRI radio.

The BTS O&M has detected an extension baseband module (for example, FBBC) on the same QSFP port, which is different than the previously removed baseband card, such as FBBA. The BTS needs to be reset to use the module. 8. An FSP unit wasn't ready during the BTS startup, for example, because of a unit boot software update. The BTS needs to be reset to put the module into use. 9. The BTS clears the alarm and triggers an autonomous BTS reset to enable normal BTS operability, but the BTS reset counter has been exceeded. The operator needs to perform a BTS reset to enable operation in the BTS. 10. There is an internal problem resulting in a failure of activation or deactivation of a snapshot collection, triggered by the syslog substring. A BTS reset performed by the operator might solve this issue. 11. The phase synchronization source wasn't available in the BTS startup, and an alarm with fault 4153 was raised. The phase synchronization source is available. A BTS reset is needed to activate features requiring network-level synchronization (OTDOA, eICIC, MBMS, and Inter-BTS carrier aggregation). 12. The BTS can't execute an FSP or BTS autonomous recovery reset due to one of the following reasons: - It will turn off all working cells. - There is an internal BTS limitation. Note: This case is available only on the BTS. 13. The FSP card is plugged but not detected. A BTS reset is needed to recover the FSP. 14. The FSP autonomous recovery reset has failed. A BTS reset is necessary to try to recover the FSP. Note: This case is available only on the Flexi SBTS. 17. The FSP power fails after clearing fault 4077 (the FSP is overheated). A BTS reset is needed to try to put the FSP into use. 18. The module plug-in software is downloaded to the BTS for O-RAN radio units that were operational before. A BTS reset is needed for the software to take effect. 19.1. The FSP is lost due to fault 10 (no connection to a unit). If the affected FSP supports the WCDMA cells, then a site reset is needed to recover the WCDMA cells. 19.2.

The loose phase time synchronization source is available. A BTS reset is needed to activate features requiring loose phase-level synchronization (for example, eDRX). 21.1. During the BTS runtime, the BTS O&M system has (re)detected resources necessary for the cell setup, for example, a commissioned secondary core. a) FSMF + FSMF: To use the resources, in the case of GSM and WCDMA, a site reset is necessary. The GSM RAT or WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. b) AirScale + FSMF: The baseband topology calculation isn't possible for a BTS hardware configuration that includes the split radio module(s) connected to both BTS cores (requires inter-core RP3 timing alignment, which temporarily deactivates the LTE cells). To use the resources, in the case of GSM and WCDMA, a site reset is necessary. The GSM RAT or WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. c) AirScale + FSMF: The baseband resources are reallocated due to a short SRIO link break. To use the resources, in the case of GSM, a RAT reset is necessary. The GSM RAT is the source of fault in this case. d) AirScale + AirScale (WCDMA is commissioned on both BTS primary and secondary cores): To use the resources, in the case of WCDMA, a RAT reset is necessary. The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. e) AirScale + AirScale (WCDMA is commissioned on both BTS primary and secondary cores, or WCDMA is commissioned only on a BTS secondary core): The BTS secondary core (that was detected during the BTS startup) is reset (hot remove & hot insert) in runtime.

The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. 21.2 During the BTS runtime, the BTS O&M system has (re)detected resources necessary for the cell setup, for example, a commissioned BBMOD. a) AirScale + AirScale or AirScale (Single Core) or AirScale + FSMF: A BBMOD (that was detected but uncommissioned during the BTS startup) is commissioned after startup, and WCDMA BB resources are recalculated and allocated to bring full WCDMA operability. In the case of WCDMA, to use the resources, a RAT reset is necessary. The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. b) AirScale + AirScale or AirScale (Single Core) or AirScale + FSMF: A BBMOD (that is running Distributed WCDMA RAT SW) is reset in runtime. In the case of WCDMA, to use the resources, a RAT reset is necessary. The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. 22.1.

    "meaning":"This fault indicates the BTS WiFi access point has detected repeated authentication failures for a device within a short period of time. This could signal a potential password guessing attack. To guard against potential password guessing attacks, per the detection covered in the description of \"Wifi Repeated Authentication Failure\" alarm indication, the BTS shall use peer-specific exponential backoff to force suspect devices\/users to wait longer and longer before each authentication request. In the addition to the per user\/device exponential backoff, the BTS shall also use general waiting measures to guard against the case where an attacker rapidly rotates his\/her Wi-Fi mac address and\/or username, thus potentially avoiding the per device exponential backoff. Following information will be provided under the alarm diagnostic info field in uncommisioned case only: BSSID to which the client has provided wrong authentication attempts. Format: {$BSSID_X}, {BSSID_Y}, {BSSID_Z} E.g: {BSSID1}, {BSSID2}, {BSSID3} Note 1: BSSID details are removed from alarm diagnostic info if no new client login failure is detected on corresponding BSSID after timeout.
