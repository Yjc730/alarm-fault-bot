The cause of the alarm can be: 1. The reference frequency has changed because of a fault in the transmission network synchronization, which in turn is caused by an equipment fault or a setting error. Note that if the network synchronization malfunction lasts for a long time, the alarm is canceled when the BTS frequency reaches the faulty reference synchronization. The alarm can also be activated if the faulty reference synchronization is corrected and there is, again, a difference of 0.2 ppm or more. The alarm is canceled whenever the difference becomes less than 0.2 ppm. 2. The reference frequency fluctuates continuously because of a significant amount of jitter or wander in the transmission network. The alarm is continuously activated or canceled.

You can access the stored history data through WEBUI.

Depending on the possible reason, follow the instructions below:\n\n1. In the case of a fault in the transmission network synchronization, you need to correct the network synchronization. The long-term accuracy of the signal used for sync needs to be 0.015 ppm or better (check the correct accuracy by measuring it). No actions on the BTS are necessary.\n\n2. If the basic accuracy of the signal used for sync is correct, but there is too much instability, that is, the jitter/wander is outside the acceptable limits, you need to correct the synchronization of the transmission network. The limits for the jitter/wander are defined in ITU-T G.823/824/825. No actions on the BTS are needed.\n\n3. In the case of a BTS equipment fault, the location might be:\n\nTransport part:\n- Check the alarms of the TRS signal used for synchronization with WEBUI and act accordingly.\n\nRAP unit:\n- If the TDM reference signal accuracy and the TRS are in order but the RAP unit is still alarming, run the fast tuning with WEBUI.\n- If the alarm is still active after the fast tuning is finished, reset the site. If the problem doesn't disappear in a few minutes, reset the site.\n- If that doesn't help, replace the RAP unit.\n\nNote that if the reason is in the transmission network synchronization, replacing the faulty unit doesn't solve the problem. Furthermore, the alarm activity (frequent alarms/cancels) points to instability in the transmission network, not to a fault in the unit.\n\n4. After the faulty situation has been cleared, you might need to tune the BTS master clock because the BTS master clock adjustment is quite slow. You can perform the tuning:\n- manually by changing the DAC word (during a site visit).\n- with fast tuning, in which the BTS master clock is tuned in a few minutes automatically near the Iub reference (normal tuning takes care of the fine tuning).\nNote, however, that you need to only use the fast tuning if the Iub reference signal is known to be a good one. Otherwise, the BTS frequency might be tuned into a totally incorrect value, causing serious problems in the network performance.\n\nBackground information: The principle is that, in the mobile network, the synchronization goes from the S1 interface. But in reality, that chain might be broken somewhere and, for example, when using leased lines, the BTS might take the reference synchronization from the transmission network of another operator.

    "meaning": "5G BTS, Flexi BTS FDD, Flexi BTS TDD, AirScale BTS TDD, AirScale BTS FDD, Flexi SBTS, AirScale SBTS: The reference frequency that the BTS master clock receives has changed by about 0.2 ppm or more (which equals the change magnitude of 204 DAC steps or more - with 12-bit DAC) during the measurement period, as compared to the BTS master clock frequency. The cause of the alarm can be: 1. The reference frequency has changed because of a fault in the transmission network synchronization, which in turn is caused by an equipment fault or a setting error. Note that if the network synchronization malfunction lasts for a long time, the alarm is canceled when the BTS frequency reaches the faulty reference synchronization. The alarm can also be activated if the faulty reference synchronization is corrected and there is, again, a difference of 0.2 ppm or more. The alarm is canceled whenever the difference becomes less than 0.2 ppm. 2. The reference frequency fluctuates continuously because of a significant amount of jitter or wander in the transmission network. The alarm is continuously activated or canceled. However, the alarming state might predominate. There is always some jitter or wander in the transmission network; the limits are defined in ITU-T G.823/824/825. 3. If the BTS-integrated transport part receives the synchronization information through the 2.048 MHz synchronization input (external clock source), the alarm situation might be caused by a fault of that signal. In that case, the alarm behavior notifications listed with the Iub signal (see the above) are also valid. 4. There is an equipment fault in the BTS. The equipment fault is, however, not the most common reason. Normally, the reason is in the Iub or reference signal behavior (see the descriptions above).",
    "effect": "5G BTS, Flexi BTS FDD, Flexi BTS TDD, AirScale BTS TDD, AirScale BTS FDD, Flexi SBTS, AirScale SBTS:\nThis fault doesn't immediately affect the operations of the BTS, but it's a notification that the BTS master clock frequency deviates from the used reference frequency more than in normal circumstances.\n\nThe BTS master clock tuning continues regardless of the alarm, but because the BTS master clock adjustment is quite slow to filter the instabilities of the reference clock interface, it takes some time (even several hours) before the BTS operations start to be affected.\n\nThe fault impacts only LTE and NR cells.",
    "instructions": "5G BTS:\nBecause there are several possibilities for the alarm activation, the BTS Clock Frequency History feature has been developed. You can access the stored history data through WEBUI. You can use the history data as a tool for finding out the reason for the fault or alarm (for further instructions about the history feature, see the online help of WEBUI). Depending on the possible reason, follow the instructions below:\n\n1. In the case of a fault in the transmission network synchronization, you need to correct the network synchronization. The long-term accuracy of the signal used for sync needs to be 0.015 ppm or better (check the correct accuracy by measuring it). No actions on the BTS are necessary.\n\n2. If the basic accuracy of the signal used for sync is correct, but there is too much instability, that is, the jitter/wander is outside the acceptable limits, you need to correct the synchronization of the transmission network. The limits for the jitter/wander are defined in ITU-T G.823/824/825. No actions on the BTS are needed.\n\n3. In the case of a BTS equipment fault, the location might be:\n\nTransport part:\n- Check the alarms of the TRS signal used for synchronization with WEBUI and act accordingly.\n\nRAP unit:\n- If the TDM reference signal accuracy and the TRS are in order but the RAP unit is still alarming, run the fast tuning with WEBUI.\n- If the alarm is still active after the fast tuning is finished, reset the site. If the problem doesn't disappear in a few minutes, reset the site.\n- If that doesn't help, replace the RAP unit.\n\nNote that if the reason is in the transmission network synchronization, replacing the faulty unit doesn't solve the problem. Furthermore, the alarm activity (frequent alarms/cancels) points to instability in the transmission network, not to a fault in the unit.\n\n4. After the faulty situation has been cleared, you might need to tune the BTS master clock because the BTS master clock adjustment is quite slow. You can perform the tuning:\n- manually by changing the DAC word (during a site visit).\n- with fast tuning, in which the BTS master clock is tuned in a few minutes automatically near the Iub reference (normal tuning takes care of the fine tuning).\nNote, however, that you need to only use the fast tuning if the Iub reference signal is known to be a good one. Otherwise, the BTS frequency might be tuned into a totally incorrect value, causing serious problems in the network performance.\n\nBackground information: The principle is that, in the mobile network, the synchronization goes from the S1 interface. But in reality, that chain might be broken somewhere and, for example, when using leased lines, the BTS might take the reference synchronization from the transmission network of another operator. This doesn't harm the system if the synchronization of the leased line service provider is also accurate/stable enough. The BTS uses the incoming synchronization signal as a reference for the Air interface, the accuracy requirement of which is set by 3GPP.\n\nFlexi BTS FDD, Flexi BTS TDD, AirScale BTS TDD, AirScale BTS FDD, Flexi SBTS, AirScale SBTS:\nBecause there are several possibilities for the alarm activation, the BTS Clock Frequency History feature has been developed.

You can access the stored history data through BTS Element Manager. You can use the history data as a tool for finding out the reason for the fault/alarm situation (for further instructions about the history feature, see the online help of BTS Element Manager). Depending on the possible reason, follow the instructions below:\n\n1. In the case of a fault in the transmission network synchronization, you need to correct the network synchronization. The long-term accuracy of the signal used for synchronization needs to be 0.015 ppm or better (check the correct accuracy by measuring it). No actions on the BTS are necessary.\n\n2. If the basic accuracy of the signal used for synchronization is correct, but there is too much instability, that is, the jitter/wander is outside the acceptable limits, you need to correct the synchronization of the transmission network. The limits for the jitter/wander are defined in ITU-T G.823/824/825. No actions on the BTS are needed.\n\n3. In the case of a BTS equipment fault, the location might be:\n\nTransport part:\n- Check the alarms of the TRS signal used for the synchronization with BTS Element Manager and act accordingly.\n\nASIx unit:\n- If the TDM reference signal accuracy and the TRS are in order but the ASIx unit is still alarming, run the fast tuning with BTS Element Manager.\n- If the alarm is still active after the fast tuning is finished, reset the site. If the problem doesn't disappear in a few minutes, reset the site.\n- If that doesn't help, replace the ASIx unit.\nNote: If the reason is in the transmission network synchronization, replacing the faulty unit doesn't solve the problem. Furthermore, the alarm activity (frequent alarms/cancels) points to instability in the transmission network, not to a fault in the unit.\n\n4. After the fault situation has been cleared, you might need to tune the BTS master clock because the BTS master clock adjustment is quite slow. You can perform the tuning:\n- manually by changing the DAC word (during a site visit).\n- with fast tuning, in which the BTS master clock is tuned in a few minutes automatically near the Iub reference (normal tuning takes care of the fine tuning).\nNote, however, that you need to use the fast tuning only if the Iub reference signal is known to be a good one. Otherwise, the BTS frequency might be tuned to a completely incorrect value, causing serious problems in the network performance.\n\nBackground information: The principle is that in the mobile network, the synchronization goes from the S1 interface. But in reality, that chain might be broken somewhere and, for example, when using leased lines, the BTS might take the reference synchronization from the transmission network of another operator. This doesn't harm the system if the synchronization of the leased line service provider is also accurate/stable enough. The BTS uses the incoming synchronization signal as a reference for the Air interface, the accuracy requirement of which is set by 3GPP.\n\nAirScale BTS FDD, AirScale BTS TDD, AirScale SBTS, Flexi BTS FDD, Flexi BTS TDD, Flexi SBTS:\nNote: Perform the steps below in the listed order until the fault disappears.\n1. Check the other alarms of the BTS and FCT, and act accordingly.\n2. If there are no other synchronization-related alarms active, start the fast tuning manually.\n3. Reset the site. Run fast tuning again.\n4. Check the reference signal accuracy by measuring it with a frequency counter (requires a good timebase for the counter).\nThe reference signal can be found from the Sync Out interface of the system module — the required accuracy is +/- 0.015 ppm.\nIf the reference accuracy is correct, run fast tuning.\n5.

    "used in product": "AirScale SBTS; Flexi SBTS",
    "source": "BCF/BTS\nWCEL\nLNCEL\nNRCELL",
    "meaning": "Due to a failure, the BTSOAM has detected during BTS startup, BTS recommissioning, or BTS resource reassignment that at least one of the following items is missing: - Radio resources - Flexi signal processing (FSP) resource - Cables between the system module and the radio unit (RU), cables between the extension baseband module (FBBx or ABIx) and the RU, or inter-ABIO-Loki in-phase and quadrature (IQ) links to set up the cell according to the configuration requested in the site configuration file (SCF) - Physical random access channel (PRACH) resources - Layer 3 pool resources. This fault is detected when a unit that supports a cell is replaced by another unit whose hardware differs from the hardware of the previous unit (different capacity, type of ports, and so on). A BTS reset might be required. The fault is detected for cells with sufficient digital signal processing resources that are configured in the same carrier aggregation pool as the cell with missing DSP resources. The fault can be detected for cells planned to be allocated to an ABIO, ABIN, or ABIQ capacity plug-in unit when BBMOD.bbmodBoardConfigType of that unit is set to \"auto\", and the correct board configuration can't be deduced from the SCF. The fault can also be detected for an AirScale BTS due to an incorrect baseband pool configuration when the baseband pooling feature is activated (actBbpooling set to \"true\"). This fault is detected when the RP3-01 links are lost between one of the following pairs: - System modules (in the case of Flexi Multiradio 10 System Module (FSMF) + FSMF) - System module and its connected RU - Capacity plug-in unit (ABIA) and a system module (in the case of AirScale BTS + FSMF) - Capacity plug-in unit (ABIA) and a capacity extension sub-module (FBBx) (in the case of AirScale BTS + FSMF) This fault is detected when the beam ID range isn't broad enough to allocate the TDD Massive MIMO (mMIMO) cell to the Enhanced Common Public Radio Interface (eCPRI) TDD Massive MIMO Adaptive Antenna (MAA) or RU. The fault is detected when there aren't enough carrier component resources for the TDD mMIMO cell allocated on the eCPRI TDD MAA or RU product code. It's detected when there aren't enough extended antenna carrier (eAxC) addresses for the TDD mMIMO cell located on the eCPRI TDD MAA or RU product code. It's also detected when BBMOD.prioritizedRAT mismatches the actual site configuration on ABIN. The fault can also be detected for a 5G cell due to: - an improper 5G beamforming RU type. - not supporting external antenna beamforming. - not supporting external antenna with subsectorization. - not supporting antenna panel split mode. - configuring a beamforming cell for a non-beamforming RU. - using an AHQK RU for external antenna beamforming. - an insufficient RU memory cache for the requested PIDs. - the total number of PIDs with type RealTimeSRSDL allocated per radio exceeds rtPidCapacity. — It isn't applicable to standalone FSMF/FSIH and FSMF+FSMF configurations. The fault is detected for a 5G beamforming cell if the detected radio isn't a 5G O-RAN radio or doesn't support beamforming. The fault can also be detected for a 5G cell when cell allocation is impossible due to commissioned cells on CPRI-A RUs or due to a Nokia Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI-N) RU being cabled in the same ABIL board. This fault can be detected for a 5G cell that is on a capacity plug-in unit supporting physical resource block (PRB) pooling (ABIO, ABIN, ABIP, ABIQ), or on an ASOE or ASOF core unit when the PRB pooling is enabled on the gNB without free baseband pool capability for the current dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) RM of the PRACH index pair {12,13,40} or {14,15,41,42,43}. This fault can be detected for a 5G cell when a capacity plug-in unit or core module port associated with one or more LOGLINKs has exceeded its defined port capacity. This fault can also be detected for a 5G cell due to a degraded cell setup during 5G Cell Lock or Delta Recommissioning if the 5G cell is enabled, degraded, or online. This fault can be detected for an unsupported broken-cell type combination. This fault can be detected due to a wrong configuration of parameters for ABIO/ASOE. This fault can be detected for NR FDD cells with a bandwidth larger than 20 MHz to be placed on the baseband card or cells exceeding baseband resources when BBMOD.prioritizedRAT is set to \"LTE\" or \"NR\". The fault can be detected when ABIQ is in concurrent mode or concurrent tri-mode and a cell with NRCELL.numberOfRxBeamforming set to 8Rx is being assigned to this board.",
    "effect": "The BTS capacity is affected. The cell fails if the necessary resources are no longer available. Otherwise, it degrades.",
    "instructions": "If \"Not enough radio resources for cell detected\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the cell might not be set up because not enough radio resources are detected. Check if all links (logical connections or cables) and SFPs connecting the RUs to the system module (or to the extension baseband module FBBx or ABIx) work correctly. If they don't, replace the RU. Alternatively, recommission the BTS with fewer cells.\n\nIf \"Incorrect radio hardware for cell detected\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the cell might not be set up because radio resources that disable the cell setup are detected. Check what RU hardware is necessary to set up the cell, for example, the number and type of antenna ports, and use the RU with the required hardware.\n\nIf \"Not enough DSP or baseband pool resources for cell detected\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, check if the BTS configuration is consistent with the used hardware. It's possible that there aren't enough FSP resources to support the cells configured in an SCF.\nThe fault is reported for the AirScale BTS when at least one of the following situations occurs:\n- Too many cells are allocated to a baseband pool.\n- The second baseband pool (ABIx) isn't used to allocate the cells.\n- The AirScale BTS isn't powered up.\n- BBMOD.bbmodBoardConfigType of that ABIO, ABIN, or ABIQ is set to 'Auto', and the correct board configuration can't be deduced from the SCF.\n- SMOD.smodBoardConfigType of that ASOE is set to 'Auto', and the correct board configuration can't be deduced from the SCF. This is not applicable to standalone FSMF or FSIH and FSMF+FSMF configurations.\n- actTddPrePooling is set to 'false' while the total number of UL streams for all NRCELLs is greater than 4 UL (for ABIL or ASOD).\n- There are 5G cells with mixed different bandwidths or MIMO modes in the same ABIO or ASOE.\n- There are DSS and non-DSS 5G cells in the same ABIO.\n- There is an RF split connection to multiple ABIOs when there is already one of the mixed configurations from number 6 or 7.\n- BBMOD.prioritizedRAT mismatches the actual site configuration on ABIN, ABIO, ABIP, or ABIQ. This is not applicable to standalone FSMF or FSIH and FSMF+FSMF configurations.\n- SMOD.smodBoardConfigType of ASOE is set to 'NRFDD_and_NRTDD_NRTDD', and more than 3 cells have been configured with a bandwidth larger than 30 MHz—not applicable to standalone FSMF or FSIH and FSMF+FSMF configurations.\n- The BTS is unable to determine the appropriate subcell type due to improper parameters for ABIO/ASOE.\n\nTry performing the following actions:\n1. Recommission the BTS with fewer cells.\n2. Add an FBBx or ABIx card.\n3. Reconfigure the baseband pools (if actBbpooling is set to \"true\").\n4. Reconfigure bbmodBoardConfigType for ABIO, ABIN, or ABIQ.\n5. Reconfigure smodBoardConfigType for ASOE—not applicable to standalone FSMF or FSIH and FSMF+FSMF configurations.\n6. Reconfigure prioritizedRAT for ABIN, ABIO, ABIP, or ABIQ —not applicable to standalone FSMF or FSIH and FSMF+FSMF configurations.\n7. Reconfigure cell parameters for ABIO/ASOE.\n\nIf the recommissioning didn't solve the issue and the extension baseband module (FBBx or ABIx) is used, perform the following actions:\n1. Ensure that all links (logical connections or a power cable and baseband bus cables) are connected to the FBBx or ABIx unit.\n2. Block and unblock the BTS.\n3. If the previous step didn't help, replace the FBBx or ABIx unit.\nIf at the same time, an alarm caused by fault 4001 (the BTS reset) is reported, a BTS reset might help.\n\nIf the recommissioning didn't solve the issue and the extension baseband module (FBBx or ABIx) isn't used, perform the following actions:\n1. Block and unblock the BTS.\n2. If the previous step didn't help, replace the system module.\n\nIf \"Not enough DSP resources for a cell detected due to insufficient number of HW activation licenses\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, do the following:\n1. Enable the full baseband unit capacity by setting BBMOD.useFullCapacity to \"true\".\n2. If LNBTS.actBbPooling is set to \"true\" and BBMOD.bbCardUsage is set to \"2\", then:\n- set BBMOD.bbCardUsage to \"1\" (as with BBMOD.useFullCapacity set to \"false\", only a single baseband pool is accessible, that is, half of the baseband resources).\n- disable the baseband pooling feature by setting LNBTS.actBbPooling to \"false\".\n\nIf \"HW resources missing for CA configuration\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the cells can have sufficient DSP resources, but they are configured in the same carrier aggregation pool as the cells with missing DSP resources. This alarm diagnostic information appears for all the cells configured in the same carrier aggregation pool. Identify the cells with missing DSP resources and use the instructions for the \"Not enough DSP or baseband pool resources for cell detected\" diagnostic information to solve the issue.\n\nIf \"Not enough link capacity on fronthaul or internal connections or SFP(s) for cell detected\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the cell:\n- might not be set up.\n- might be degraded (for the GSM cell type).\nThis can happen because the detected cables don't provide the required throughput or the inter-ABIO-Loki IQ routing limit is exceeded. Add or replace the cables or SFPs, or decrease the number of configured cells.\n\nIf “Uplane calculation failure due to not enough cabling throughput” is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the cell might not be set up because the detected cables don't provide the required throughput as they aren't correctly configured. Reconfigure the cables or add supplementary cables. If new cables are added to supplement the throughput, then a BTS reset is needed.\n\nIf \"Detected hardware doesn't allow to setup cell according to configuration\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the cell might not be set up because hardware resources are detected but don't enable the cell setup. Check if the planned configuration is supported by Nokia, or if the used hardware is capable of supporting the planned configuration.\n\nIf \"Not enough PRACH resources for cell detected\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, check if the BTS configuration is consistent with the used hardware. It's possible that there aren't enough PRACH root sequence resources to support the cells configured in the SCF. Perform the following actions:\n1. Recommission parameters to change the PRACH root sequence resources requirement:\n- PRACH cyclic shift [prachCs]\n- PRACH configuration index [prachConfIndex]\n- PRACH high-speed flag [prachHsFlag]\n2. If the recommissioning didn't solve the issue, add an FBBx or ABIx card and recommission it.\n\nIf \"Not enough L3 resources for cell detected\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, in the BTS in a dual-core configuration (for example, ASIx + ASIx), a cell might not be set up because the L3 pool for the cell is located on a secondary core that isn't detected. Perform the following actions:\n1. Block and unblock the BTS to reset it.\n2. If it doesn't help, ensure that the secondary core is properly connected to the rack.\n3. If it doesn't help, replace the faulty unit.\n\nIf \"Missing RP3-01 cable or not enough capacity between cores\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information in the BTS in a dual-core configuration (for example, ASIx + FSMF):\n1. Execute a BTS block and unblock it to reset the BTS.\n2. If the previous step didn't help, ensure that the secondary core is properly connected to the rack.\n3. If the previous step didn't help, replace the faulty unit.\n\nIf \"Not enough FHS delay buffers detected\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the cell might not be set up because there are insufficient delay buffers in the fronthaul switch for the CPRI-A channels. Check if the links between the fronthaul switch and the system module work and replace the cables or SFPs if necessary. If that doesn't resolve the issue, add more links between the fronthaul switch and the system module if possible.\n\nIf “Not enough resources to allocate the TDD cell to the eCPRI TDD radio” is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the TDD cell allocated on the eCPRI TDD RU or MAA radio fails due to insufficient carrier component resources. Perform the following actions:\n1. Decrease the number of carriers (cells) configured.\n2. Replace the radio module with one that supports more carriers.\n3. If the previous step didn't help, contact Nokia for support with the eAxC mapping file check.\n\nIf “Not enough eAxC addresses to allocate the TDD cell to the eCPRI TDD radio\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the TDD cell allocated on the eCPRI TDD RU or MAA radio fails due to not enough eAxC addresses for the PUxCH, PDxCH, PRACH, or SRS. Perform the following actions:\n1. Replace the RU with one with a higher capacity.\n2. Contact Nokia for support with the eAxC mapping file check.\n\nIf “Not enough Beam Id range to allocate the TDD cell to the eCPRI TDD radio” is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the TDD cell allocated on the eCPRI TDD RU or MAA radio fails due to not enough beam IDs in the eCPRI MAA storage. Perform the following actions:\n1. Replace the RU with one with a higher capacity.\n2. Contact Nokia to check the maximum number of beams per cell in vendor parameters or the radio capability with beam ID storage.\n\nIf \"Antenna beamforming type is not supported by radio module\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the cell isn't set up because the RU doesn't support the integrated or external antenna, which is necessary to configure the cell.\n\nIf “The detected radio is not a 5G O-RAN radio, or it doesn't support beamforming” is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the cell can't be set up because the detected radio isn't an O-RAN radio, or it doesn't support beamforming. Replace the radio module with an O-RAN radio module that supports beamforming.\n\nIf \"Cell allocation is impossible due to the fact that the cells are commissioned on CPRI-A radios as well as CPRI-N radio cabled in the same ABIL board\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the cell can't be set up because the cells are commissioned on CPRI-N and CPRI-A radios cabled to the same ABIL board. Replace or re-cable the radios so that only the CPRI-N or CPRI-A radios are connected to the same ABIL board.\n\nIf \"Not enough radio hardware due to primary link change\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the cell might not be set up because the detected cables don't provide the required throughput. Identify the radios configured to support the cell. Then, check if all the links (logical connections or cables) and SFPs connecting the radio modules to the system module (or to the extension baseband module—FBBx or ABIx) work correctly.\n\nIf \"Too many DSS-RM rate matching cells with the same PRACH index pair {12,13,40} or {14,15,41,42,43}\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the cell can't be set up because too many DSS cells have the PRACH index pair {12,13,40} or {14,15,41,42,43}. With the PRB pooling activated, the PRACH indexes for DSS cells with rate matching activated need to be evenly spread between the values {12,13,40} and {14,15,41,42,43} for the cells connected to the same baseband board. Reconfigure the cells using a different PRACH index.\n\nIf \"Cell failed due to Degraded Cell Setup\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, check for any other alarms impacting this cell and clear them by following the corresponding fault instructions. This fault needs to be cleared automatically as soon as all other alarms impacting the cell are cleared, therefore allowing cell setup.\n\nIf \"Not enough LOW_LEVEL_ENDPOINT resources\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information and none of the cell channels can be assigned to the appropriate antenna array, change the cell configuration (for example, reduce the number of channels) to the one that is supported—not applicable to standalone FSMF or FSIH and FSMF+FSMF configurations.\n\nIf \"Not enough radio memory cache to setup the cell\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, in case the requested PID is out of RU available memory cache range or the total number of PIDs with type RealTimeSRSDL allocated per radio exceeds rtPidCapacity. Lock or unlock all cells for PIDs reassignment. If it doesn't help, features that require PIDs allocation for some cells on an RU should be disabled.—It isn't applicable to standalone FSMF/FSIH and FSMF+FSMF configurations.\n\nIf \"On concurrent mode or concurrent tri-mode, NRCELL.numberOfRxBeamforming is equal to 8Rx\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information perform one of the following steps:\n1. Change the boardConfigType to be single mode\n2. Change the value of NRCELL.numberOfRxBeamforming from 8Rx to 4Rx"

    "used in product": "AirScale SBTS; Flexi SBTS",
    "source": "BCF/BTS\nWCEL\nLNCEL\nNRCELL",
    "meaning": "Due to a failure, the BTSOAM has detected during BTS startup, BTS recommissioning, or BTS resource reassignment that at least one of the following items is missing: - Radio resources - Flexi signal processing (FSP) resource - Cables between the system module and the radio unit (RU), cables between the extension baseband module (FBBx or ABIx) and the RU, or inter-ABIO-Loki in-phase and quadrature (IQ) links to set up the cell according to the configuration requested in the site configuration file (SCF) - Physical random access channel (PRACH) resources - Layer 3 pool resources. This fault is detected when a unit that supports a cell is replaced by another unit whose hardware differs from the hardware of the previous unit (different capacity, type of ports, and so on). A BTS reset might be required. The fault is detected for cells with sufficient digital signal processing resources that are configured in the same carrier aggregation pool as the cell with missing DSP resources. The fault can be detected for cells planned to be allocated to an ABIO, ABIN, or ABIQ capacity plug-in unit when BBMOD.bbmodBoardConfigType of that unit is set to \"auto\", and the correct board configuration can't be deduced from the SCF. The fault can also be detected for an AirScale BTS due to an incorrect baseband pool configuration when the baseband pooling feature is activated (actBbpooling set to \"true\"). This fault is detected when the RP3-01 links are lost between one of the following pairs: - System modules (in the case of Flexi Multiradio 10 System Module (FSMF) + FSMF) - System module and its connected RU - Capacity plug-in unit (ABIA) and a system module (in the case of AirScale BTS + FSMF) - Capacity plug-in unit (ABIA) and a capacity extension sub-module (FBBx) (in the case of AirScale BTS + FSMF) This fault is detected when the beam ID range isn't broad enough to allocate the TDD Massive MIMO (mMIMO) cell to the Enhanced Common Public Radio Interface (eCPRI) TDD Massive MIMO Adaptive Antenna (MAA) or RU. The fault is detected when there aren't enough carrier component resources for the TDD mMIMO cell allocated on the eCPRI TDD MAA or RU product code. It's detected when there aren't enough extended antenna carrier (eAxC) addresses for the TDD mMIMO cell located on the eCPRI TDD MAA or RU product code. It's also detected when BBMOD.prioritizedRAT mismatches the actual site configuration on ABIN. The fault can also be detected for a 5G cell due to: - an improper 5G beamforming RU type. - not supporting external antenna beamforming. - not supporting external antenna with subsectorization. - not supporting antenna panel split mode. - configuring a beamforming cell for a non-beamforming RU. - using an AHQK RU for external antenna beamforming. - an insufficient RU memory cache for the requested PIDs. - the total number of PIDs with type RealTimeSRSDL allocated per radio exceeds rtPidCapacity. — It isn't applicable to standalone FSMF/FSIH and FSMF+FSMF configurations. The fault is detected for a 5G beamforming cell if the detected radio isn't a 5G O-RAN radio or doesn't support beamforming. The fault can also be detected for a 5G cell when cell allocation is impossible due to commissioned cells on CPRI-A RUs or due to a Nokia Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI-N) RU being cabled in the same ABIL board. This fault can be detected for a 5G cell that is on a capacity plug-in unit supporting physical resource block (PRB) pooling (ABIO, ABIN, ABIP, ABIQ), or on an ASOE or ASOF core unit when the PRB pooling is enabled on the gNB without free baseband pool capability for the current dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) RM of the PRACH index pair {12,13,40} or {14,15,41,42,43}. This fault can be detected for a 5G cell when a capacity plug-in unit or core module port associated with one or more LOGLINKs has exceeded its defined port capacity. This fault can also be detected for a 5G cell due to a degraded cell setup during 5G Cell Lock or Delta Recommissioning if the 5G cell is enabled, degraded, or online. This fault can be detected for an unsupported broken-cell type combination. This fault can be detected due to a wrong configuration of parameters for ABIO/ASOE. This fault can be detected for NR FDD cells with a bandwidth larger than 20 MHz to be placed on the baseband card or cells exceeding baseband resources when BBMOD.prioritizedRAT is set to \"LTE\" or \"NR\". The fault can be detected when ABIQ is in concurrent mode or concurrent tri-mode and a cell with NRCELL.numberOfRxBeamforming set to 8Rx is being assigned to this board.",
    "effect": "The BTS capacity is affected. The cell fails if the necessary resources are no longer available. Otherwise, it degrades.",
    "instructions": "If \"Not enough radio resources for cell detected\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the cell might not be set up because not enough radio resources are detected. Check if all links (logical connections or cables) and SFPs connecting the RUs to the system module (or to the extension baseband module FBBx or ABIx) work correctly. If they don't, replace the RU. Alternatively, recommission the BTS with fewer cells.\n\nIf \"Incorrect radio hardware for cell detected\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the cell might not be set up because radio resources that disable the cell setup are detected. Check what RU hardware is necessary to set up the cell, for example, the number and type of antenna ports, and use the RU with the required hardware.\n\nIf \"Not enough DSP or baseband pool resources for cell detected\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, check if the BTS configuration is consistent with the used hardware. It's possible that there aren't enough FSP resources to support the cells configured in an SCF.\nThe fault is reported for the AirScale BTS when at least one of the following situations occurs:\n- Too many cells are allocated to a baseband pool.\n- The second baseband pool (ABIx) isn't used to allocate the cells.\n- The AirScale BTS isn't powered up.\n- BBMOD.bbmodBoardConfigType of that ABIO, ABIN, or ABIQ is set to 'Auto', and the correct board configuration can't be deduced from the SCF.\n- SMOD.smodBoardConfigType of that ASOE is set to 'Auto', and the correct board configuration can't be deduced from the SCF. This is not applicable to standalone FSMF or FSIH and FSMF+FSMF configurations.\n- actTddPrePooling is set to 'false' while the total number of UL streams for all NRCELLs is greater than 4 UL (for ABIL or ASOD).\n- There are 5G cells with mixed different bandwidths or MIMO modes in the same ABIO or ASOE.\n- There are DSS and non-DSS 5G cells in the same ABIO.\n- There is an RF split connection to multiple ABIOs when there is already one of the mixed configurations from number 6 or 7.\n- BBMOD.prioritizedRAT mismatches the actual site configuration on ABIN, ABIO, ABIP, or ABIQ. This is not applicable to standalone FSMF or FSIH and FSMF+FSMF configurations.\n- SMOD.smodBoardConfigType of ASOE is set to 'NRFDD_and_NRTDD_NRTDD', and more than 3 cells have been configured with a bandwidth larger than 30 MHz—not applicable to standalone FSMF or FSIH and FSMF+FSMF configurations.\n- The BTS is unable to determine the appropriate subcell type due to improper parameters for ABIO/ASOE.\n\nTry performing the following actions:\n1. Recommission the BTS with fewer cells.\n2. Add an FBBx or ABIx card.\n3. Reconfigure the baseband pools (if actBbpooling is set to \"true\").\n4. Reconfigure bbmodBoardConfigType for ABIO, ABIN, or ABIQ.\n5. Reconfigure smodBoardConfigType for ASOE—not applicable to standalone FSMF or FSIH and FSMF+FSMF configurations.\n6. Reconfigure prioritizedRAT for ABIN, ABIO, ABIP, or ABIQ —not applicable to standalone FSMF or FSIH and FSMF+FSMF configurations.\n7. Reconfigure cell parameters for ABIO/ASOE.\n\nIf the recommissioning didn't solve the issue and the extension baseband module (FBBx or ABIx) is used, perform the following actions:\n1. Ensure that all links (logical connections or a power cable and baseband bus cables) are connected to the FBBx or ABIx unit.\n2. Block and unblock the BTS.\n3. If the previous step didn't help, replace the FBBx or ABIx unit.\nIf at the same time, an alarm caused by fault 4001 (the BTS reset) is reported, a BTS reset might help.\n\nIf the recommissioning didn't solve the issue and the extension baseband module (FBBx or ABIx) isn't used, perform the following actions:\n1. Block and unblock the BTS.\n2. If the previous step didn't help, replace the system module.\n\nIf \"Not enough DSP resources for a cell detected due to insufficient number of HW activation licenses\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, do the following:\n1. Enable the full baseband unit capacity by setting BBMOD.useFullCapacity to \"true\".\n2. If LNBTS.actBbPooling is set to \"true\" and BBMOD.bbCardUsage is set to \"2\", then:\n- set BBMOD.bbCardUsage to \"1\" (as with BBMOD.useFullCapacity set to \"false\", only a single baseband pool is accessible, that is, half of the baseband resources).\n- disable the baseband pooling feature by setting LNBTS.actBbPooling to \"false\".\n\nIf \"HW resources missing for CA configuration\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the cells can have sufficient DSP resources, but they are configured in the same carrier aggregation pool as the cells with missing DSP resources. This alarm diagnostic information appears for all the cells configured in the same carrier aggregation pool. Identify the cells with missing DSP resources and use the instructions for the \"Not enough DSP or baseband pool resources for cell detected\" diagnostic information to solve the issue.\n\nIf \"Not enough link capacity on fronthaul or internal connections or SFP(s) for cell detected\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the cell:\n- might not be set up.\n- might be degraded (for the GSM cell type).\nThis can happen because the detected cables don't provide the required throughput or the inter-ABIO-Loki IQ routing limit is exceeded. Add or replace the cables or SFPs, or decrease the number of configured cells.\n\nIf “Uplane calculation failure due to not enough cabling throughput” is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the cell might not be set up because the detected cables don't provide the required throughput as they aren't correctly configured. Reconfigure the cables or add supplementary cables. If new cables are added to supplement the throughput, then a BTS reset is needed.\n\nIf \"Detected hardware doesn't allow to setup cell according to configuration\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the cell might not be set up because hardware resources are detected but don't enable the cell setup. Check if the planned configuration is supported by Nokia, or if the used hardware is capable of supporting the planned configuration.\n\nIf \"Not enough PRACH resources for cell detected\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, check if the BTS configuration is consistent with the used hardware. It's possible that there aren't enough PRACH root sequence resources to support the cells configured in the SCF. Perform the following actions:\n1. Recommission parameters to change the PRACH root sequence resources requirement:\n- PRACH cyclic shift [prachCs]\n- PRACH configuration index [prachConfIndex]\n- PRACH high-speed flag [prachHsFlag]\n2. If the recommissioning didn't solve the issue, add an FBBx or ABIx card and recommission it.\n\nIf \"Not enough L3 resources for cell detected\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, in the BTS in a dual-core configuration (for example, ASIx + ASIx), a cell might not be set up because the L3 pool for the cell is located on a secondary core that isn't detected. Perform the following actions:\n1. Block and unblock the BTS to reset it.\n2. If it doesn't help, ensure that the secondary core is properly connected to the rack.\n3. If it doesn't help, replace the faulty unit.\n\nIf \"Missing RP3-01 cable or not enough capacity between cores\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information in the BTS in a dual-core configuration (for example, ASIx + FSMF):\n1. Execute a BTS block and unblock it to reset the BTS.\n2. If the previous step didn't help, ensure that the secondary core is properly connected to the rack.\n3. If the previous step didn't help, replace the faulty unit.\n\nIf \"Not enough FHS delay buffers detected\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the cell might not be set up because there are insufficient delay buffers in the fronthaul switch for the CPRI-A channels. Check if the links between the fronthaul switch and the system module work and replace the cables or SFPs if necessary. If that doesn't resolve the issue, add more links between the fronthaul switch and the system module if possible.\n\nIf “Not enough resources to allocate the TDD cell to the eCPRI TDD radio” is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the TDD cell allocated on the eCPRI TDD RU or MAA radio fails due to insufficient carrier component resources. Perform the following actions:\n1. Decrease the number of carriers (cells) configured.\n2. Replace the radio module with one that supports more carriers.\n3. If the previous step didn't help, contact Nokia for support with the eAxC mapping file check.\n\nIf “Not enough eAxC addresses to allocate the TDD cell to the eCPRI TDD radio\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the TDD cell allocated on the eCPRI TDD RU or MAA radio fails due to not enough eAxC addresses for the PUxCH, PDxCH, PRACH, or SRS. Perform the following actions:\n1. Replace the RU with one with a higher capacity.\n2. Contact Nokia for support with the eAxC mapping file check.\n\nIf “Not enough Beam Id range to allocate the TDD cell to the eCPRI TDD radio” is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the TDD cell allocated on the eCPRI TDD RU or MAA radio fails due to not enough beam IDs in the eCPRI MAA storage. Perform the following actions:\n1. Replace the RU with one with a higher capacity.\n2. Contact Nokia to check the maximum number of beams per cell in vendor parameters or the radio capability with beam ID storage.\n\nIf \"Antenna beamforming type is not supported by radio module\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the cell isn't set up because the RU doesn't support the integrated or external antenna, which is necessary to configure the cell.\n\nIf “The detected radio is not a 5G O-RAN radio, or it doesn't support beamforming” is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the cell can't be set up because the detected radio isn't an O-RAN radio, or it doesn't support beamforming. Replace the radio module with an O-RAN radio module that supports beamforming.\n\nIf \"Cell allocation is impossible due to the fact that the cells are commissioned on CPRI-A radios as well as CPRI-N radio cabled in the same ABIL board\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the cell can't be set up because the cells are commissioned on CPRI-N and CPRI-A radios cabled to the same ABIL board. Replace or re-cable the radios so that only the CPRI-N or CPRI-A radios are connected to the same ABIL board.\n\nIf \"Not enough radio hardware due to primary link change\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the cell might not be set up because the detected cables don't provide the required throughput. Identify the radios configured to support the cell. Then, check if all the links (logical connections or cables) and SFPs connecting the radio modules to the system module (or to the extension baseband module—FBBx or ABIx) work correctly.\n\nIf \"Too many DSS-RM rate matching cells with the same PRACH index pair {12,13,40} or {14,15,41,42,43}\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, the cell can't be set up because too many DSS cells have the PRACH index pair {12,13,40} or {14,15,41,42,43}. With the PRB pooling activated, the PRACH indexes for DSS cells with rate matching activated need to be evenly spread between the values {12,13,40} and {14,15,41,42,43} for the cells connected to the same baseband board. Reconfigure the cells using a different PRACH index.\n\nIf \"Cell failed due to Degraded Cell Setup\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, check for any other alarms impacting this cell and clear them by following the corresponding fault instructions. This fault needs to be cleared automatically as soon as all other alarms impacting the cell are cleared, therefore allowing cell setup.\n\nIf \"Not enough LOW_LEVEL_ENDPOINT resources\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information and none of the cell channels can be assigned to the appropriate antenna array, change the cell configuration (for example, reduce the number of channels) to the one that is supported—not applicable to standalone FSMF or FSIH and FSMF+FSMF configurations.\n\nIf \"Not enough radio memory cache to setup the cell\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information, in case the requested PID is out of RU available memory cache range or the total number of PIDs with type RealTimeSRSDL allocated per radio exceeds rtPidCapacity. Lock or unlock all cells for PIDs reassignment. If it doesn't help, features that require PIDs allocation for some cells on an RU should be disabled.—It isn't applicable to standalone FSMF/FSIH and FSMF+FSMF configurations.\n\nIf \"On concurrent mode or concurrent tri-mode, NRCELL.numberOfRxBeamforming is equal to 8Rx\" is displayed in the alarm diagnostic information perform one of the following steps:\n1. Change the boardConfigType to be single mode\n2. Change the value of NRCELL.numberOfRxBeamforming from 8Rx to 4Rx"

    "meaning": "This fault notifies the operator that the BTS needs a reset to solve a problem discovered by the BTS O&M system. 1. The BTS has detected a commissioned (configured in SCF) extension baseband module (FBBC, ABIA, or ABIC) that wasn't detected during the BTS startup. Thus, the BTS needs to be reset to use the module. 6. The BTS O&M system has detected (in runtime) radio unit (RU) resources necessary for the cell setup, which weren't detected during the BTS startup, for example, a commissioned RU (configured in an SCF) or an optical cable. The BTS needs to be reset to set up the cell with the use of the detected RU or cable. In this case, LCR is the source of the fault. This is valid for all RATs except for 4G and 5G cells. If actCellAutoRecalculation is set, the 4G or 5G cell can be configured on any BBMOD (excluding FSMr3, ABIA, and ABIC) and mapped to an OBSAI, CPRI, or eCPRI radio. It's not applicable to FSMF/FSIH and FSMF+FSMF configurations. 7. The BTS O&M has detected an extension baseband module (for example, FBBC) on the same QSFP port, which is different than the previously removed baseband card, such as FBBA. The BTS needs to be reset to use the module. 8. An FSP unit wasn't ready during the BTS startup, for example, because of a unit boot software update. The BTS needs to be reset to put the module into use. 9. The BTS clears the alarm and triggers an autonomous BTS reset to enable normal BTS operability, but the BTS reset counter has been exceeded. The operator needs to perform a BTS reset to enable operation in the BTS. 10. There is an internal problem resulting in a failure of activation or deactivation of a snapshot collection, triggered by the syslog substring. A BTS reset performed by the operator might solve this issue. 11. The phase synchronization source wasn't available in the BTS startup, and an alarm with fault 4153 was raised. The phase synchronization source is available. A BTS reset is needed to activate features requiring network-level synchronization (OTDOA, eICIC, MBMS, and Inter-BTS carrier aggregation). 12. The BTS can't execute an FSP or BTS autonomous recovery reset due to one of the following reasons: - It will turn off all working cells. - There is an internal BTS limitation. Note: This case is available only on the BTS. 13. The FSP card is plugged but not detected. A BTS reset is needed to recover the FSP. 14. The FSP autonomous recovery reset has failed. A BTS reset is necessary to try to recover the FSP. Note: This case is available only on the Flexi SBTS. 17. The FSP power fails after clearing fault 4077 (the FSP is overheated). A BTS reset is needed to try to put the FSP into use. 18. The module plug-in software is downloaded to the BTS for O-RAN radio units that were operational before. A BTS reset is needed for the software to take effect. 19.1. The FSP is lost due to fault 10 (no connection to a unit). If the affected FSP supports the WCDMA cells, then a site reset is needed to recover the WCDMA cells. 19.2. The FSP is detected after clearing fault 4077 (FSP overheated) or fault 10 (no connection to a unit). If the affected FSP supports the WCDMA cells and all FSPs supporting WCDMA are enabled, then a RAT reset is needed to recover the WCDMA cells. If the affected FSP supports the WCDMA cells and no FSP supporting WCDMA is enabled, then a site reset is needed to recover the WCDMA cells. If the affected FSP supports the GSM cells, then a RAT reset is needed to recover the GSM cells. 20. The loose phase time synchronization source wasn't available in the BTS startup, and an alarm with fault 4404 (timing accuracy not guaranteed to be within configured LTE limits for loose HSFN) or 2417 (timing accuracy not guaranteed to be within configured GSM limits for loose HSFN) was raised. The loose phase time synchronization source is available. A BTS reset is needed to activate features requiring loose phase-level synchronization (for example, eDRX). 21.1. During the BTS runtime, the BTS O&M system has (re)detected resources necessary for the cell setup, for example, a commissioned secondary core. a) FSMF + FSMF: To use the resources, in the case of GSM and WCDMA, a site reset is necessary. The GSM RAT or WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. b) AirScale + FSMF: The baseband topology calculation isn't possible for a BTS hardware configuration that includes the split radio module(s) connected to both BTS cores (requires inter-core RP3 timing alignment, which temporarily deactivates the LTE cells). To use the resources, in the case of GSM and WCDMA, a site reset is necessary. The GSM RAT or WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. c) AirScale + FSMF: The baseband resources are reallocated due to a short SRIO link break. To use the resources, in the case of GSM, a RAT reset is necessary. The GSM RAT is the source of fault in this case. d) AirScale + AirScale (WCDMA is commissioned on both BTS primary and secondary cores): To use the resources, in the case of WCDMA, a RAT reset is necessary. The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. e) AirScale + AirScale (WCDMA is commissioned on both BTS primary and secondary cores, or WCDMA is commissioned only on a BTS secondary core): The BTS secondary core (that was detected during the BTS startup) is reset (hot remove & hot insert) in runtime. In the case of WCDMA, to use the resources, a RAT reset is necessary. The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. 21.2 During the BTS runtime, the BTS O&M system has (re)detected resources necessary for the cell setup, for example, a commissioned BBMOD. a) AirScale + AirScale or AirScale (Single Core) or AirScale + FSMF: A BBMOD (that was detected but uncommissioned during the BTS startup) is commissioned after startup, and WCDMA BB resources are recalculated and allocated to bring full WCDMA operability. In the case of WCDMA, to use the resources, a RAT reset is necessary. The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. b) AirScale + AirScale or AirScale (Single Core) or AirScale + FSMF: A BBMOD (that is running Distributed WCDMA RAT SW) is reset in runtime. In the case of WCDMA, to use the resources, a RAT reset is necessary. The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. 22.1. The BTS O&M has a late detection of the RP3-01 link, which wasn't available during the BTS startup and before the deployment calculation, while the source of synchronization between cores is provided by the SyncOut/SyncIn link.

    "meaning": "This fault notifies the operator that the BTS needs a reset to solve a problem discovered by the BTS O&M system. 1. The BTS has detected a commissioned (configured in SCF) extension baseband module (FBBC, ABIA, or ABIC) that wasn't detected during the BTS startup. Thus, the BTS needs to be reset to use the module. 6. The BTS O&M system has detected (in runtime) radio unit (RU) resources necessary for the cell setup, which weren't detected during the BTS startup, for example, a commissioned RU (configured in an SCF) or an optical cable. The BTS needs to be reset to set up the cell with the use of the detected RU or cable. In this case, LCR is the source of the fault. This is valid for all RATs except for 4G and 5G cells. If actCellAutoRecalculation is set, the 4G or 5G cell can be configured on any BBMOD (excluding FSMr3, ABIA, and ABIC) and mapped to an OBSAI, CPRI, or eCPRI radio. It's not applicable to FSMF/FSIH and FSMF+FSMF configurations. 7. The BTS O&M has detected an extension baseband module (for example, FBBC) on the same QSFP port, which is different than the previously removed baseband card, such as FBBA. The BTS needs to be reset to use the module. 8. An FSP unit wasn't ready during the BTS startup, for example, because of a unit boot software update. The BTS needs to be reset to put the module into use. 9. The BTS clears the alarm and triggers an autonomous BTS reset to enable normal BTS operability, but the BTS reset counter has been exceeded. The operator needs to perform a BTS reset to enable operation in the BTS. 10. There is an internal problem resulting in a failure of activation or deactivation of a snapshot collection, triggered by the syslog substring. A BTS reset performed by the operator might solve this issue. 11. The phase synchronization source wasn't available in the BTS startup, and an alarm with fault 4153 was raised. The phase synchronization source is available. A BTS reset is needed to activate features requiring network-level synchronization (OTDOA, eICIC, MBMS, and Inter-BTS carrier aggregation). 12. The BTS can't execute an FSP or BTS autonomous recovery reset due to one of the following reasons: - It will turn off all working cells. - There is an internal BTS limitation. Note: This case is available only on the BTS. 13. The FSP card is plugged but not detected. A BTS reset is needed to recover the FSP. 14. The FSP autonomous recovery reset has failed. A BTS reset is necessary to try to recover the FSP. Note: This case is available only on the Flexi SBTS. 17. The FSP power fails after clearing fault 4077 (the FSP is overheated). A BTS reset is needed to try to put the FSP into use. 18. The module plug-in software is downloaded to the BTS for O-RAN radio units that were operational before. A BTS reset is needed for the software to take effect. 19.1. The FSP is lost due to fault 10 (no connection to a unit). If the affected FSP supports the WCDMA cells, then a site reset is needed to recover the WCDMA cells. 19.2. The FSP is detected after clearing fault 4077 (FSP overheated) or fault 10 (no connection to a unit). If the affected FSP supports the WCDMA cells and all FSPs supporting WCDMA are enabled, then a RAT reset is needed to recover the WCDMA cells. If the affected FSP supports the WCDMA cells and no FSP supporting WCDMA is enabled, then a site reset is needed to recover the WCDMA cells. If the affected FSP supports the GSM cells, then a RAT reset is needed to recover the GSM cells. 20. The loose phase time synchronization source wasn't available in the BTS startup, and an alarm with fault 4404 (timing accuracy not guaranteed to be within configured LTE limits for loose HSFN) or 2417 (timing accuracy not guaranteed to be within configured GSM limits for loose HSFN) was raised. The loose phase time synchronization source is available. A BTS reset is needed to activate features requiring loose phase-level synchronization (for example, eDRX). 21.1. During the BTS runtime, the BTS O&M system has (re)detected resources necessary for the cell setup, for example, a commissioned secondary core. a) FSMF + FSMF: To use the resources, in the case of GSM and WCDMA, a site reset is necessary. The GSM RAT or WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. b) AirScale + FSMF: The baseband topology calculation isn't possible for a BTS hardware configuration that includes the split radio module(s) connected to both BTS cores (requires inter-core RP3 timing alignment, which temporarily deactivates the LTE cells). To use the resources, in the case of GSM and WCDMA, a site reset is necessary. The GSM RAT or WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. c) AirScale + FSMF: The baseband resources are reallocated due to a short SRIO link break. To use the resources, in the case of GSM, a RAT reset is necessary. The GSM RAT is the source of fault in this case. d) AirScale + AirScale (WCDMA is commissioned on both BTS primary and secondary cores): To use the resources, in the case of WCDMA, a RAT reset is necessary. The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. e) AirScale + AirScale (WCDMA is commissioned on both BTS primary and secondary cores, or WCDMA is commissioned only on a BTS secondary core): The BTS secondary core (that was detected during the BTS startup) is reset (hot remove & hot insert) in runtime. In the case of WCDMA, to use the resources, a RAT reset is necessary. The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. 21.2 During the BTS runtime, the BTS O&M system has (re)detected resources necessary for the cell setup, for example, a commissioned BBMOD. a) AirScale + AirScale or AirScale (Single Core) or AirScale + FSMF: A BBMOD (that was detected but uncommissioned during the BTS startup) is commissioned after startup, and WCDMA BB resources are recalculated and allocated to bring full WCDMA operability. In the case of WCDMA, to use the resources, a RAT reset is necessary. The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. b) AirScale + AirScale or AirScale (Single Core) or AirScale + FSMF: A BBMOD (that is running Distributed WCDMA RAT SW) is reset in runtime. In the case of WCDMA, to use the resources, a RAT reset is necessary. The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. 22.1.

If actCellAutoRecalculation is set, the 4G or 5G cell can be configured on any BBMOD (excluding FSMr3, ABIA, and ABIC) and mapped to an OBSAI, CPRI, or eCPRI radio. It's not applicable to FSMF/FSIH and FSMF+FSMF configurations. 7. The BTS O&M has detected an extension baseband module (for example, FBBC) on the same QSFP port, which is different than the previously removed baseband card, such as FBBA. The BTS needs to be reset to use the module. 8. An FSP unit wasn't ready during the BTS startup, for example, because of a unit boot software update. The BTS needs to be reset to put the module into use. 9. The BTS clears the alarm and triggers an autonomous BTS reset to enable normal BTS operability, but the BTS reset counter has been exceeded. The operator needs to perform a BTS reset to enable operation in the BTS. 10. There is an internal problem resulting in a failure of activation or deactivation of a snapshot collection, triggered by the syslog substring. A BTS reset performed by the operator might solve this issue. 11. The phase synchronization source wasn't available in the BTS startup, and an alarm with fault 4153 was raised. The phase synchronization source is available. A BTS reset is needed to activate features requiring network-level synchronization (OTDOA, eICIC, MBMS, and Inter-BTS carrier aggregation). 12. The BTS can't execute an FSP or BTS autonomous recovery reset due to one of the following reasons: - It will turn off all working cells. - There is an internal BTS limitation. Note: This case is available only on the BTS. 13. The FSP card is plugged but not detected. A BTS reset is needed to recover the FSP. 14. The FSP autonomous recovery reset has failed. A BTS reset is necessary to try to recover the FSP. Note: This case is available only on the Flexi SBTS. 17. The FSP power fails after clearing fault 4077 (the FSP is overheated). A BTS reset is needed to try to put the FSP into use. 18. The module plug-in software is downloaded to the BTS for O-RAN radio units that were operational before. A BTS reset is needed for the software to take effect. 19.1. The FSP is lost due to fault 10 (no connection to a unit). If the affected FSP supports the WCDMA cells, then a site reset is needed to recover the WCDMA cells. 19.2. The FSP is detected after clearing fault 4077 (FSP overheated) or fault 10 (no connection to a unit). If the affected FSP supports the WCDMA cells and all FSPs supporting WCDMA are enabled, then a RAT reset is needed to recover the WCDMA cells. If the affected FSP supports the WCDMA cells and no FSP supporting WCDMA is enabled, then a site reset is needed to recover the WCDMA cells. If the affected FSP supports the GSM cells, then a RAT reset is needed to recover the GSM cells. 20. The loose phase time synchronization source wasn't available in the BTS startup, and an alarm with fault 4404 (timing accuracy not guaranteed to be within configured LTE limits for loose HSFN) or 2417 (timing accuracy not guaranteed to be within configured GSM limits for loose HSFN) was raised. The loose phase time synchronization source is available. A BTS reset is needed to activate features requiring loose phase-level synchronization (for example, eDRX). 21.1. During the BTS runtime, the BTS O&M system has (re)detected resources necessary for the cell setup, for example, a commissioned secondary core. a) FSMF + FSMF: To use the resources, in the case of GSM and WCDMA, a site reset is necessary. The GSM RAT or WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. b) AirScale + FSMF: The baseband topology calculation isn't possible for a BTS hardware configuration that includes the split radio module(s) connected to both BTS cores (requires inter-core RP3 timing alignment, which temporarily deactivates the LTE cells). To use the resources, in the case of GSM and WCDMA, a site reset is necessary. The GSM RAT or WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. c) AirScale + FSMF: The baseband resources are reallocated due to a short SRIO link break. To use the resources, in the case of GSM, a RAT reset is necessary. The GSM RAT is the source of fault in this case. d) AirScale + AirScale (WCDMA is commissioned on both BTS primary and secondary cores): To use the resources, in the case of WCDMA, a RAT reset is necessary. The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. e) AirScale + AirScale (WCDMA is commissioned on both BTS primary and secondary cores, or WCDMA is commissioned only on a BTS secondary core): The BTS secondary core (that was detected during the BTS startup) is reset (hot remove & hot insert) in runtime. In the case of WCDMA, to use the resources, a RAT reset is necessary. The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. 21.2 During the BTS runtime, the BTS O&M system has (re)detected resources necessary for the cell setup, for example, a commissioned BBMOD. a) AirScale + AirScale or AirScale (Single Core) or AirScale + FSMF: A BBMOD (that was detected but uncommissioned during the BTS startup) is commissioned after startup, and WCDMA BB resources are recalculated and allocated to bring full WCDMA operability. In the case of WCDMA, to use the resources, a RAT reset is necessary. The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. b) AirScale + AirScale or AirScale (Single Core) or AirScale + FSMF: A BBMOD (that is running Distributed WCDMA RAT SW) is reset in runtime. In the case of WCDMA, to use the resources, a RAT reset is necessary. The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. 22.1. The BTS O&M has a late detection of the RP3-01 link, which wasn't available during the BTS startup and before the deployment calculation, while the source of synchronization between cores is provided by the SyncOut/SyncIn link. A BTS reset is needed to cover the affected cells. 22.2. The BTS O&M has a late detection of the RP3-01 link, which wasn't available during the BTS startup and before the deployment calculation when the RP3-01 link is used for the GSM and WCDMA IQ data routing between ABIA and FSMF/FBBx (in AirScale + FSMF dual-core configuration). A BTS reset is needed to cover the affected cells. 24. SYNC.phaseErrorRecoveryThreshold is exceeded. A BTS reset is needed to clear the synchronization phase error. 25. The BTS can't synchronize with the RRH in the CPRI-K RF sharing because of clock crossing buffer underflow or overflow in the RX block. A BTS reset is needed to synchronize with RRH (radio). 26. Plan activation is stuck due to an unknown reason. A BTS reset is needed to recover. 30. The $FeatureName feature triggers a recovery reset due to the time to recover below its allowed time error, which is above the limit, as configured in $syncTemplateDn. Where: - $FeatureName is the name of the feature (for example, 'OTDOA'). - $syncTemplateDn is the distinguished name of the SYNCTEMPLATE instance linked to the feature, for example, 'MRBTS-1/MNL-1/MNLENT-1/SYNC-1/SYNCTEMPLATE-1'. An example of an alarm text: 'The feature OTDOA triggers a recovery reset due to the time to recover below its allowed time error is above the limit as configured in MRBTS-1/MNL-1/MNLENT-1/SYNC-1/SYNCTEMPLATE-1.' It's not applicable to FSMF/FSIH and FSMF+FSMF configurations.",
    "effect": "The effect depends on the case when the fault is detected. For more information, see the \"Meaning\" field.",
    "instructions": "To find the reason for the fault report, check the alarm diagnostic information before the reset. Note that the currently degraded cell setup isn't supported.\nIf a BTS reset is executed when any of the cells has an availability status of \"degraded,\" the cell might not be enabled after the reset and won't provide any service.\n\nThe degraded cells can be also found based on active alarms.\n\nIf actCategoryAlarms is set to 'false,' alarm 7654 Cell Operation Degraded is reported for each degraded cell."

The loose phase time synchronization source is available. A BTS reset is needed to activate features requiring loose phase-level synchronization (for example, eDRX). 21.1. During the BTS runtime, the BTS O&M system has (re)detected resources necessary for the cell setup, for example, a commissioned secondary core. a) FSMF + FSMF: To use the resources, in the case of GSM and WCDMA, a site reset is necessary. The GSM RAT or WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. b) AirScale + FSMF: The baseband topology calculation isn't possible for a BTS hardware configuration that includes the split radio module(s) connected to both BTS cores (requires inter-core RP3 timing alignment, which temporarily deactivates the LTE cells). To use the resources, in the case of GSM and WCDMA, a site reset is necessary. The GSM RAT or WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. c) AirScale + FSMF: The baseband resources are reallocated due to a short SRIO link break. To use the resources, in the case of GSM, a RAT reset is necessary. The GSM RAT is the source of fault in this case. d) AirScale + AirScale (WCDMA is commissioned on both BTS primary and secondary cores): To use the resources, in the case of WCDMA, a RAT reset is necessary. The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. e) AirScale + AirScale (WCDMA is commissioned on both BTS primary and secondary cores, or WCDMA is commissioned only on a BTS secondary core): The BTS secondary core (that was detected during the BTS startup) is reset (hot remove & hot insert) in runtime. In the case of WCDMA, to use the resources, a RAT reset is necessary. The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. 21.2 During the BTS runtime, the BTS O&M system has (re)detected resources necessary for the cell setup, for example, a commissioned BBMOD. a) AirScale + AirScale or AirScale (Single Core) or AirScale + FSMF: A BBMOD (that was detected but uncommissioned during the BTS startup) is commissioned after startup, and WCDMA BB resources are recalculated and allocated to bring full WCDMA operability. In the case of WCDMA, to use the resources, a RAT reset is necessary. The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. b) AirScale + AirScale or AirScale (Single Core) or AirScale + FSMF: A BBMOD (that is running Distributed WCDMA RAT SW) is reset in runtime. In the case of WCDMA, to use the resources, a RAT reset is necessary. The WCDMA RAT is the source of fault in this case. 22.1. The BTS O&M has a late detection of the RP3-01 link, which wasn't available during the BTS startup and before the deployment calculation, while the source of synchronization between cores is provided by the SyncOut/SyncIn link. A BTS reset is needed to cover the affected cells. 22.2. The BTS O&M has a late detection of the RP3-01 link, which wasn't available during the BTS startup and before the deployment calculation when the RP3-01 link is used for the GSM and WCDMA IQ data routing between ABIA and FSMF/FBBx (in AirScale + FSMF dual-core configuration). A BTS reset is needed to cover the affected cells. 24. SYNC.phaseErrorRecoveryThreshold is exceeded. A BTS reset is needed to clear the synchronization phase error. 25. The BTS can't synchronize with the RRH in the CPRI-K RF sharing because of clock crossing buffer underflow or overflow in the RX block. A BTS reset is needed to synchronize with RRH (radio). 26. Plan activation is stuck due to an unknown reason. A BTS reset is needed to recover. 30. The $FeatureName feature triggers a recovery reset due to the time to recover below its allowed time error, which is above the limit, as configured in $syncTemplateDn. Where: - $FeatureName is the name of the feature (for example, 'OTDOA'). - $syncTemplateDn is the distinguished name of the SYNCTEMPLATE instance linked to the feature, for example, 'MRBTS-1/MNL-1/MNLENT-1/SYNC-1/SYNCTEMPLATE-1'. An example of an alarm text: 'The feature OTDOA triggers a recovery reset due to the time to recover below its allowed time error is above the limit as configured in MRBTS-1/MNL-1/MNLENT-1/SYNC-1/SYNCTEMPLATE-1.' It's not applicable to FSMF/FSIH and FSMF+FSMF configurations.",

Use NMS operational feedback or WebEM to get the list of checkpoints and HW with NOK results.\n\n2. Use the network management system operational feedback or WebEM to get the list of checkpoints and hardware with NOK results:\n- If checkpoint “1”, “7”, or “8” fails, attempt a fix through commissioning.\n- If checkpoint “2” fails, first ensure that checkpoint “1” passes without a failure or a fix was successfully applied to it before attempting a checkpoint “2” fix through a software upgrade.\n- If checkpoints “3”, “5”, “6”, or “16” fail, attempt a fix through a software upgrade.\n- If checkpoint “4” fails, disable the “netboot only” option.\n- If checkpoint “9” fails, check the configured thresholds, and then check and replace the radio unit (RU) external power supply if that doesn’t help.\n- If checkpoint “10” fails, check the configured thresholds, and then check the power source that provides voltage to the problematic input. If there is no issue with it, replace the power cable.\n- If checkpoint “35” fails, check fault 69 “POST test fails,” reset the alarming unit or module, and then remove or reinsert it. If that didn’t help, replace the alarming unit or module.\n- If checkpoint “17” fails, attempt a fix through a software upgrade.\nWarning: After a software upgrade, the SW Rollback operation may fail.\n- If checkpoint “18” fails, follow the 1936, 1937, and 1938 fault descriptions in Customer Documentation.\n- If checkpoint “19” fails, follow the 4077 fault description in Customer Documentation.\n- If checkpoint “21” fails, check the physical fronthaul cable link and its components.\n- If checkpoint “22” fails, check the cablink and configuration at the remote peer, and then check the fronthaul network configuration.\n- If checkpoint “24” fails, check the backplane connectors. If it doesn’t help, replace the faulty module. If the fault isn't cleared, replace the FCM or FCT (system module or baseband module).\n- If checkpoint “26” fails, check if the cable connecting the system module and RU, the cable connecting the extension baseband module and RU, or the cable connecting the fronthaul switch module and RU is fixed firmly to the modules. If the fault isn't cleared, replace the cable and the faulty module. If that doesn’t help, replace the fan.\n- If checkpoints “29” and “30” fail, check the condition of the SFP optical part, as the transmitter can be damaged or dirty.\n- If checkpoint “31” fails, check the active critical alarm. Then, follow the fault instructions.\n- If checkpoint “34” fails, replace the affected hardware module (the baseband module or system module for which fault 248:EFaultId_UncorrectableMemoryEccErrAl is active).\n- If checkpoint “40” fails:\n          1. attempt the fix through SW upgrade. \n          2. Replace HW.\n- If checkpoint “41” fails, reset the RU.\n- If checkpoint “42” fails, no actions are required. There are redundant sensors that can be used.\n- If checkpoint “36” or “43” fails, replace the HW.\n- If checkpoint \"11\" fails, perform a BTS reset.\n- If checkpoint \"13\" fails, collect a BTS snapshot and ask Nokia to check it.\n- If checkpoint \"14\" fails, replace the broken HW unit in the system module.\n- If checkpoint \"15\" fails:\n1. Refrain from requesting any procedure that involves restarting the alarming module (for example, a SW update) until the alarming module is replaced.\n2. Replace the alarming module.\n\n- If checkpoint \"20\" fails, follow the fault description in Customer Documentation.\n- If checkpoint \"28\" fails, check the technical condition of the SFP optical part, as the transmitter part can be damaged or dirty.\n- If checkpoint \"32\" fails, ensure that the module is properly connected.\n- If checkpoint \"33\" fails:\n1. Check active alarms related to faults 4352, 23, or 4364. If not, rerun the checkpoint to exclude a secondary core reset.\n2. Execute a BTS block and/or unblock to reset the BTS.\n3. Ensure that the module is properly connected to the racks.\n4. Check that the secondary core is configured in a dual-core mode.\n5. Check if the software version on the secondary core is the same as the primary core.\n6. Replace the faulty unit.\n\n- If checkpoint \"23\" fails:\n1. Reset the alarming unit/board.\n2.

If the clock mode of the local Ethernet interface is “slave” (ETHLK_R.detectedClock) and the Ethernet interface is configured to serve as synchronization source to the BTS synchronization priority list, then the alarm is caused by a clock mode mismatch.\n2.1 Check the clock mode setting of the remote link partner.

This could signal a potential password guessing attack. To guard against potential password guessing attacks, per the detection covered in the description of \"Wifi Repeated Authentication Failure\" alarm indication, the BTS shall use peer-specific exponential backoff to force suspect devices/users to wait longer and longer before each authentication request. In the addition to the per user/device exponential backoff, the BTS shall also use general waiting measures to guard against the case where an attacker rapidly rotates his/her Wi-Fi mac address and/or username, thus potentially avoiding the per device exponential backoff. Following information will be provided under the alarm diagnostic info field in uncommisioned case only: BSSID to which the client has provided wrong authentication attempts. Format: {$BSSID_X}, {BSSID_Y}, {BSSID_Z} E.g: {BSSID1}, {BSSID2}, {BSSID3} Note 1: BSSID details are removed from alarm diagnostic info if no new client login failure is detected on corresponding BSSID after timeout.
